    NOTE: This will currently not take into considerations situations
    in which a file was partially downloaded. If a file is partially
    downloaded, a re-download will not take place and rather an
    installation will be attempted, which will obviously fail since
    the rpm file is incomplete.
    ALSO NOTE: you cannot provide `yum_install` with a space
    separated array of packages as you can with `yum install`. You must
    provide one package per invocation.
