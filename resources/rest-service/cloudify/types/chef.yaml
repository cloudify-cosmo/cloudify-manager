                # with the addition of the resource (file in blueprint's
                # directory) option. For consistency, the Cloudify Chef plugin
                # in both cases (URL or resource), downloads the cookbooks to
                # a local file and `solo.rb` has the reference to that file.

                # * The referenced file is a `.tar.gz` file that is extracted
                #   to appropriate folder by the Cloudify Chef plugin. For
                #   user's convenience, the `.tar.gz` file can either have
                #   the needed files at top level or in the appropriate
                #   directory. For example `environments.tar.gz` can have the
